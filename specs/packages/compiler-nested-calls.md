# compiler-nested-calls: Nested-Call Compilation Duties

## Intent

This package specifies compiler-definition duties for nested playbook call syntax and child-output routing.
It changes no source interpretation, runtime engine behavior, frozen compiler input, or experiment builder output.

## External Behavior

### compiler-nested-calls-1

When Source requires a literal or dynamic nested playbook call, text2gears shall emit the exact behavior verb phrase `Captain shall call playbook ...:` with any required sequencing in the `When` or `While` clause or continuation prose, not as an inserted word between `shall` and `call`.

### compiler-nested-calls-4

When Source routes more than one path into one nested playbook call with the same target and the same input template — a later path made "with the same input as" an earlier path's — text2gears shall emit one nested-call item whose condition joins the paths and whose continuation prose carries each path's outcome, not one item per path, so the compiled FSM keeps one call state entered from each path [[playbook-39](playbook.md#playbook-39)].

### compiler-nested-calls-2

When gears2fsm emits nested-call routing, after preserving Source-authored success acceptance and recovery cases plus the public control-error `onError` fallback [[playbook-runtime-84](playbook-runtime.md#playbook-runtime-84)], it shall omit an `onDone` transition whose guard cannot be reached from any legal predecessor/context after the prior ordered `onDone` arms, without requiring arbitrary finite enumeration, dropping valid failure behavior, or relaxing verifier obligations.

## Verification

### compiler-nested-calls-3

When the integration suite inspects the text2gears and gears2fsm definitions, it shall verify exact nested-call verb syntax for literal and dynamic forms, forbidden sequencing words between `shall` and `call`, the one-item-per-shared-call rule with the maintained DEV GEARS carrying exactly six items whose `code`, `decide`, and `branch` calls each join their paths in one condition, and unreachable nested-call `onDone` omission after authored routes and the control-error fallback are preserved [[compiler-nested-calls-1](#compiler-nested-calls-1)], [[compiler-nested-calls-4](#compiler-nested-calls-4)], [[compiler-nested-calls-2](#compiler-nested-calls-2)].
