# Review

Roles:

- Coder
- Reviewer

The caller supplies one caller input carrying the original intent, the review scope in the caller's own words, and optional relevant context and run results.
The caller's review scope is the baseline for every round, and each review-fix commit joins that scope as it lands, so every later round reviews the cumulative committed state.
The review workflow examines committed work only.
Captain takes the evaluated repository revision from repository authority, not from either player's prose, and uses the repository-effect receipt as the authoritative identity of any review-fix commit.
Finding numbers are references within this review only; no review transition depends on numbering or any fixed presentation format of either player's reply.
Rounds continue until Reviewer affirmatively reports that the requested review is complete and no unsettled findings remain.
The review workflow then returns the exact repository revision at which the review scope was evaluated and the fact that no unsettled findings remain within that scope.

## Review

### REVIEW-1

The review examines committed work only, and the review scope is the caller's review scope as supplied in the caller input.
Captain relays to Reviewer the original intent, the review scope and context, and any relevant run results, all carried by the caller input, in quotes after the round's instruction, and appends the shared round instruction to the end of the prompt.

When the caller starts a review with its caller input, at the first review round, Captain shall prompt Reviewer:

> A new review begins for the review scope.
> Keep to the original intent and follow what it asks.
> When the scope names commits, read each commit message for its context and rationale; otherwise use repository history and commit messages wherever they help establish that context.
>
> Understand the full picture and think systematically about the underlying design.
> Continue to identify issues or improvements, if any, without duplication.
> Number the findings consistently across rounds.
> Flag only what materially affects correctness, behavior, or spec quality — not style, equally valid alternatives, or theoretical threats.
> For specs, flag stale, missing, over-specified, or under-specified ones, if any.
> Avoid unnecessary complexity in code or tests, but flag any fundamental design flaw when leaving it would cost more in later patches than fixing it now.
>
> If an issue represents a class of defect, find every instance within the review scope worth fixing rather than surfacing one or two per round, which drags out the review.
> For any rebuttal, accept or challenge it.
> Treat as settled, and do not raise again, any finding in this review rejected twice with reasoning.
>
> Do not re-run tests or builds whose inputs have not changed since any previous reported run.
> Do not edit files or commit; report findings only.
>
> Consult @specs/map.md for context if needed; verify it remains accurate.
> Consult @specs/meta.md for spec requirements if needed; verify affected specs follow it.
>
> > Original request: <caller-input>

Results:
- `findings`: Reviewer raised one or more findings that remain unsettled. The outcome depends on the substance of Reviewer's reply, not on finding numbers or any fixed presentation format; a progress report, status update, or promise of a later result does not support this outcome. Output shall include `reviewerOutput: <verbatim final text>`.
- `clean`: Reviewer affirmatively reported that the requested review is complete and no unsettled findings remain. The outcome depends on the substance of Reviewer's reply, not on finding numbers or any fixed presentation format; a progress report, status update, or promise of a later result does not support this outcome. The review workflow then returns the exact repository revision at which the review scope was evaluated, taken from repository authority rather than from either player's prose, and the fact that no unsettled findings remain within that scope. Output shall include `evaluatedRevision: <repository revision>`.

### REVIEW-2

Captain relays to Coder the original intent, the review scope and context, and any relevant run results, all carried by the caller input, together with the Reviewer's findings, in quotes before the instruction.
Captain uses the repository-effect receipt as the authoritative identity of any review-fix commit.

When Reviewer raises or keeps any finding, Captain shall prompt Coder:

> For each review item, accept or reject it.
> Before deciding, understand the full picture and think systematically about the underlying design.
> Keep to the original intent and follow what it asks.
> Reject anything that is not essential or is not worth fixing now.
> If you accept an item, fix its root cause, including any fundamental design flaw — do not patch around it; if it represents a class of defect, find every instance within the review scope worth fixing rather than addressing one or two per round, which drags out the review.
> If you reject an item, give the reasoning and cite code or test output that supports it.
> Do not re-run tests or builds whose inputs have not changed since any previous reported run.
>
> If you accept any item, make minimal changes and add one new review-fix commit; never rewrite any existing commit.
> Follow @specs/packages/git.md.
> Make the commit message explain concisely what changed and why, including relevant verification.
> Identify every new commit you make.
> Credit every AI that contributed to this commit: Coder <coder-llm> and Reviewer <reviewer-llm>, whose findings it answers.
>
> If you reject every item, change nothing and make no commit.
> Report every disposition, all relevant run results, and every rebuttal.
>
> > Original request: <caller-input>
> > Reviewer findings: <reviewer-output>

Results:
- `committed`: Coder accepted one or more findings and made one new review-fix commit, whose identity is taken from the repository-effect receipt rather than from Coder's prose; the outcome does not depend on finding numbers or any fixed presentation format of Coder's reply. Output shall include `latestCommit: <commit identity>` and `coderOutput: <verbatim final text>`.
- `rejectedAll`: Coder rejected every finding and made no commit; the outcome does not depend on finding numbers or any fixed presentation format of Coder's reply. Output shall include `coderOutput: <verbatim final text>`.

### REVIEW-3

The review-fix commit has joined the review scope, so this round reviews the cumulative committed state of the caller's review scope.
Captain relays to Reviewer the original intent, the review scope and context, and any relevant run results carried by the caller input, the latest review-fix commit, and Coder's feedback from the preceding round, in quotes after the round's instruction, and appends the shared round instruction to the end of the prompt.

When Coder makes a new review-fix commit, at the start of the next review round, Captain shall prompt Reviewer:

> A new review round begins for the review scope in the cumulative committed state, with particular attention to the latest review-fix commit.
> Keep to the original intent and follow what it asks.
> Read the latest review-fix commit's message and see Coder's feedback below.
>
> Understand the full picture and think systematically about the underlying design.
> Continue to identify issues or improvements, if any, without duplication.
> Number the findings consistently across rounds.
> Flag only what materially affects correctness, behavior, or spec quality — not style, equally valid alternatives, or theoretical threats.
> For specs, flag stale, missing, over-specified, or under-specified ones, if any.
> Avoid unnecessary complexity in code or tests, but flag any fundamental design flaw when leaving it would cost more in later patches than fixing it now.
>
> If an issue represents a class of defect, find every instance within the review scope worth fixing rather than surfacing one or two per round, which drags out the review.
> For any rebuttal, accept or challenge it.
> Treat as settled, and do not raise again, any finding in this review rejected twice with reasoning.
>
> Do not re-run tests or builds whose inputs have not changed since any previous reported run.
> Do not edit files or commit; report findings only.
>
> Consult @specs/map.md for context if needed; verify it remains accurate.
> Consult @specs/meta.md for spec requirements if needed; verify affected specs follow it.
>
> > Original request: <caller-input>
> > Latest commit: <latest-commit>
> > Coder output: <coder-output>

Results:
- `findings`: Reviewer raised or kept one or more findings that remain unsettled. The outcome depends on the substance of Reviewer's reply, not on finding numbers or any fixed presentation format; a progress report, status update, or promise of a later result does not support this outcome. Output shall include `reviewerOutput: <verbatim final text>`.
- `clean`: Reviewer affirmatively reported that the requested review is complete and no unsettled findings remain. The outcome depends on the substance of Reviewer's reply, not on finding numbers or any fixed presentation format; a progress report, status update, or promise of a later result does not support this outcome. The review workflow then returns the exact repository revision at which the review scope was evaluated, taken from repository authority rather than from either player's prose, and the fact that no unsettled findings remain within that scope. Output shall include `evaluatedRevision: <repository revision>`.

### REVIEW-4

No new commit was made, so this round reviews the same cumulative committed state of the caller's review scope.
Captain relays to Reviewer the original intent, the review scope and context, and any relevant run results carried by the caller input, and Coder's feedback from the preceding round, in quotes after the round's instruction, and appends the shared round instruction to the end of the prompt.

When Coder rejects every finding and makes no commit, at the start of the next review round, Captain shall prompt Reviewer:

> No new commit was made because Coder rejected every finding.
> See Coder's feedback below.
>
> Understand the full picture and think systematically about the underlying design.
> Continue to identify issues or improvements, if any, without duplication.
> Number the findings consistently across rounds.
> Flag only what materially affects correctness, behavior, or spec quality — not style, equally valid alternatives, or theoretical threats.
> For specs, flag stale, missing, over-specified, or under-specified ones, if any.
> Avoid unnecessary complexity in code or tests, but flag any fundamental design flaw when leaving it would cost more in later patches than fixing it now.
>
> If an issue represents a class of defect, find every instance within the review scope worth fixing rather than surfacing one or two per round, which drags out the review.
> For any rebuttal, accept or challenge it.
> Treat as settled, and do not raise again, any finding in this review rejected twice with reasoning.
>
> Do not re-run tests or builds whose inputs have not changed since any previous reported run.
> Do not edit files or commit; report findings only.
>
> Consult @specs/map.md for context if needed; verify it remains accurate.
> Consult @specs/meta.md for spec requirements if needed; verify affected specs follow it.
>
> > Original request: <caller-input>
> > Coder output: <coder-output>

Results:
- `findings`: Reviewer kept or raised one or more findings that remain unsettled. The outcome depends on the substance of Reviewer's reply, not on finding numbers or any fixed presentation format; a progress report, status update, or promise of a later result does not support this outcome. Output shall include `reviewerOutput: <verbatim final text>`.
- `clean`: Reviewer affirmatively reported that the requested review is complete and no unsettled findings remain.
